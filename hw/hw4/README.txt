ORDER NOTATION:
For each function, using the variables:
  d = number of different movie DVD titles
  k = average or maximum copies of each DVD
  c = number of customers
  p = average or maximum movies ranked on each customerâ€™s preference list
Include a short description of your order notation analysis.


dvd:O(d)
in dvd, the for loop is O(d) as it go through inventory and other are all O(1) so sum it up would be O(d)


customer:O(cp+pk+pp)
for each customer check each preference so O(cp), for each preference check each inventory so O(pk), for each preference check each customer preference so O(pp)
other are all constant O(1) and linear, so sum up would be O(cp+pk+pp)

add_preference:O(c+d+p)
check through customer and inventory and preference list, all linear so O(c+d+p), other are all constant and linear
so sum up would be O(c+d+p)

ship:O(cp)
for each customer check each preference so O(cp), other are all constant O(1), so sum it up would be O(cp)


return_oldest:O(d+c)
check through customer and inventory, all linear so O(d+c), other are all constant so sum up would be O(d+c)

return_newest:O(d+c)
check through customer and inventory, all linear so O(d+c), other are all constant so sum up would be O(d+c)


print_customer:O(c+p)
check through customer and preference, all linear so O(p+c), other are all constant so sum up would be O(p+c)

print_dvd:O(d)
check through inventory, all linear so O(d), other are all constant so sum up would be O(d)
