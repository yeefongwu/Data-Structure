TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

i use lldb and drmemory when there is bad accessing for vector and sometimes when i
forget to add return when tree is empty i use lldb to find out.
the corner case i test is when the tree is empty, the leaf is the node
